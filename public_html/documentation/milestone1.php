	<h2>Goal:</h2>
	<p>The goal of this project is primarily to be the platform for my online prescence, facilitating developing my portfolio as a writer, photographer, and software developer;
		essentially an all-purpose brag-sheet with location/instance-specific sessions alongside a general about-me.</p>
