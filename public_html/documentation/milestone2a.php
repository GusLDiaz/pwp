		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<p>My site will be one page composed of
			these three primary components:
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Splash:</strong> The landing page-view and first seen section will consist of my portrait,
				name, and a list display with punchy titles accompanied by icons hyperlinked to appropriate media: I.E. "Fullstack Developer" accompanied by a github icon.
				Also in this section will be a button labeled PhotoJournals that presents a Bootstrap Modal describing the concept of the next section
				and offering instructions to the end user. Next to the button are the thumbnails of each of my current hosted PhotoJournals.
			</li>
			<li><strong>PhotoJournals:</strong> I want this to be a responsive Javascript-enabled page component that will host 4-7 "PhotoJournals".
				The section will cleanly display one of my PhotoJournals: a single image in a rounded frame and similar to a Bootstrap card with a short title and
				a piece of flash fiction relating to the photo, which I describe as the "Journal". Beneath and/or beside the image will
				be a minimalist pager that allows the user to click previous or next, and functionally go to the next PhotoJournal. As needed this section may have a
				separate container background overlaid on the general site for ease of viewing.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Contact Me:</strong>: This section will display a punchy, simple contact form. Their will be fields
				for input of name, email, and the actual message with corresponding iconography. this will be floating and isolated
				in the center of the section for a no-nonsense, professional tone.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>These sections will be separated by minimalist dividers that span across the screen.</p>
