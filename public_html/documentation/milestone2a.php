		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<p>My site will be one page viewed on desktop, and several "pages" (cycleable styled as a carosel) composed of
			these primary components:
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Splash:</strong> The landing page-view (for mobile) and for desktop top/first seen section will be
				a brief one-line introduction will clearly state my name and visions for career advancement as a Front End
				Developer,
				accompanying a photo, all of which will be superimposed on a large background image of a desert
				texturescape.
			</li>
			<li><strong>PhotoJournals:</strong> I want this to be a responsive Javascript-enabled page component featuring
						4-7 embedded images each associated with an short article.The sidebar will cleanly display the
						inactive images and in the center will be the active image larger and in a simple frame, with the
						article text displayed alongside.clicking one of the inactive buttons or arrows nearby will cycle the
						next image to the forefront and display its associated text.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Skills</strong>: This section will display my skill-set in punchy, simple labels around a central
				image. I will have the bottom third of the mobile screen and side panel of the horizontal section on desktop
				as a simple contact form.The content will
				be shown in a sleek and professional tone as I am looking to portray myself as an informed,
				innovation-minded developer.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Finally, all of these page- views will feature a small footer with functional iconography representing my
			social media links: Github, LinkedIn, and Instagram.</p>
