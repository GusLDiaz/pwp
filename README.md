### Milestone 1 Feedback
It actually looks like much of the feedback I had for the "Fly with Me" project can apply to this idea as well. Excellent work here on outlining your purpose, audience, goal and persona. And you have a very cool idea, and I'm simultaneously excited about it but apprehensive regarding scope: 

- Like we discussed, having a proper blogspace falls out-of-scope for this project as this would require a creating a back-end, or utilization of blogging software like WordPress. But it sounds like you understand this point.
- I anticipate that you'll definitely need to integrate some 3rd party JavaScript solutions to facilitate display of your photostories. I'd aim to keep your content and UI designs simple for sake of time, as there is plenty of room for custom-tailored and refined JS-driven interactivity and design that you may not have time for.
- Again, I advise keeping content to a very reasonable scale due to time constraints. No  interactive functionality will be included in this site to manage media here - it will all need to be done/built by you by hand.

Your project is set up correctly - but the HTML is way off. The same issues as with the "Fly with Me" project. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) - due to coding errors. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha; - really looking forward to seeing this project take shape.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Review the basic HTML document structure here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/html/. Your HTML is missing a DOCTYPE, `<head>` and `<body>`. All of the HTML you created should go inside the `<body>`.
- There are issues with your indentation and formatting - be careful to keep this correct. When a div closes, open the next one on a separate line. Not on the same line.
